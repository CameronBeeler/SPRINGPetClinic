# SPRINGPetClinic
The classic SPRING Pet-Clinic app, developing SPRING dev skills
Will build the pet clinic from the ground up.
Leveraging git through the entire process
using mainline dev approach (not multiple branches)
using git issues to plan the work
Including CI/CD approach 
Including JUNIT test driven development
and for myself, relearning VIM editor with DVORAK keyboard - eish this is difficult to unlearn ;-)
